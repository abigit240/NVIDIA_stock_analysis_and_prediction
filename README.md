# Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression and Random Forest

## Overview

This project aims to predict the stock prices of NVIDIA (NVDA) using machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. The dataset used is historical stock data from 1999 to 2023, including features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. 

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset. Explores the data with descriptive statistics and visualizations.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features such as 'Daily Return', 'Moving Average (MA_50)', and 'Volatility' to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and null rows in the dataset to ensure data quality.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes the data to bring all features to a similar scale, which can help improve model performance.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains both Linear Regression and Random Forest models on the preprocessed data. Evaluates the models' performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
6. **Prediction:** Uses the trained models to predict future stock prices (for the next year). Visualizes the predictions with plots.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Libraries:**
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * scikit-learn (sklearn)
    * IPython
## Usage

1. Upload the notebook and the 'NVDA.csv' dataset to your Google Colab environment.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
3. The notebook will generate visualizations and model performance metrics.
4. Predictions for the next year's stock prices will be displayed.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest models in predicting NVDA stock prices. Evaluation metrics like MSE and R2 are used to assess the accuracy of the predictions. Visualizations are provided to compare actual vs. predicted prices.
